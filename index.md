## ü§∑ What I do at Princeton

I'm a second-year physics student at Princeton University. At Princeton, I am a research assistant in the astrophysics department, working with Josh Winn on detecting timing deviations in the TESS transit timing data of hot Jupiters. It was shown theoretically that the orbits of many known hot Jupiters should be slowly shrinking because of the tidal interactions between the star and the planet. However, the timescale of tidal evolution is difficult to estimate theoretically. To date, the only known hot Jupiter for which orbital decay has been detected is WASP-12b. In this work, we search for evidence of tidal orbital decay by analyzing long-term timing of the transits of hot Jupiters. We are producing a list of the measured mid-transit times for each target, along with the newly-derived orbital periods.  This information will be useful to any future investigators who wish to schedule future observations of these planets ‚Äî for example, with NASA‚Äôs James Webb Space Telescope. 


## ü¶ï What I do outside of Princeton

Outside of the Orange Bubble, I work with Choukri Mekkaoui, Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School, on improving cardiac diffusion MRI registration & denoising pipelines using machine learning. Advances in cardiac diffusion tractography imaging (CDTI) have both reduced scan times and improved achievable resolution. Recently, CDTI has been used to assess myocardial structure in myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and myocardial regeneration, demonstrating unique and modality-complimentary diagnostic and prognostic value. However, in vivo DT-MRI of the heart implies a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) since the diffusion contrast relies on locally lossy signal dephasing in the presence of short myocardial T2 relaxation. Our denoising & registration protocol could shorten total scan time for CDTI by reducing the number of averages needed, which would have a big impact on patient experience and accuracy of results.  



## ü¶ï Startups

I enjoy the startup culture, and I have been a machine learning intern at GenusOne Inc. since May 2019. Working with the founding team, I've developed documentation for the company‚Äôs platform, implemented GPU-based versions of kNN and SVM classifiers in C++ and have created and tested a number of original machine learning applications. 

To learn more about startups, in Fall 2020, I have taken the "Venture Capital and Finance of Innovation" class, where I've been learning how to use capital to create value from some of the most prominent speakers in the VC world (Klein Perkins, Bain Capital, Emergence Capital, etc.)



## ü¶ï Service

I am involved with the Pace Center for Civic Engagement as a Service Focus fellow: in the Education & Access cohort, we have been examining questions related to education inequality & access to opportunity and ways we can tackle the problem. As a racial justice fellow, I have also been helping Princeton's Prison Teaching Initiative team to create lectures and assignments for the first ever Java-based Computer Science curriculum to be taught in NJ prisons.

## ü¶ï Projects

### Music Identification with Persistent Homology
- [paper](/files/music_id.pdf)
I've recently ideated and created a song identification application using persistent homology techniques (Python). The goal was to find a representation of songs as a time series of topological fingerprints, with a metric to compare pairs of time-varying shapes. My algorithm ccounts for noise distortions of input audio clips to identify music. 


### Predicting Coronal Mass Ejections Using Topological Data Analysis-based Classifier
- [paper](/files/tda.pdf)
- [code](https://github.com/kateivshina/TDA-based-classifier) 
During the summer of 2019, I have conducted independent work analyzing solar flare time-series data to predict coronal mass ejections. A Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) is a significant release of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun into interplanetary space. Despite the progress in numerical modeling, it is still unclear which conditions will produce a CME; however, it is known that CMEs and solar flares are associated as ‚Äúa single magnetically driven event‚Äù. In my study, I created a topological data analysis-based classifier in Python from scratch to predict whether an M- or X-class flaring active region will produce a CME in the next 24 hours. I then presented my results to Stanford and Harvard physics professors.

## ü¶ï Research in High School


In the summer of 2018, I studied Forbush decreases in cosmic ray flux, analyzed URAGAN hodoscope muon data, and examined barometric effects in the cosmic ray muon and neutron flux at the National Research Nuclear University MEPhI in Moscow, Russia.

I have also worked with astronomers from the Ural Federal University Observatory on builiding and testing  a flat field light source that enhances stellar spectra precision. The tool is installed in the Observatory.
