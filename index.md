## ü§∑ What I do at Princeton

I'm a second-year physics student at Princeton University. At Princeton, I am a research assistant in the astrophysics department, working with Josh Winn on detecting timing deviations in the TESS transit timing data of hot Jupiters üåç. It was shown theoretically that the orbits of many known hot Jupiters should be slowly shrinking because of the tidal interactions between the star and the planet. However, the timescale of tidal evolution is difficult to estimate theoretically. To date, the only known hot Jupiter for which orbital decay has been detected is WASP-12b. In this work, we search for evidence of tidal orbital decay by analyzing long-term timing of the transits of hot Jupiters. We are producing a list of the measured mid-transit times for each target, along with the newly-derived orbital periods.  This information will be useful to any future investigators who wish to schedule future observations of these planets ‚Äî for example, with NASA‚Äôs James Webb Space Telescope. 


## üìñ  What I do outside of Princeton

Outside of the Orange Bubble, I work with Choukri Mekkaoui, Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School, on improving cardiac diffusion MRI registration & denoising pipelines using machine learning. Advances in cardiac diffusion tractography imaging (CDTI) have both reduced scan times and improved achievable resolution. Recently, CDTI has been used to assess myocardial structure in myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and myocardial regeneration, demonstrating unique and modality-complimentary diagnostic and prognostic value. However, in vivo DT-MRI of the heart implies a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) since the diffusion contrast relies on locally lossy signal dephasing in the presence of short myocardial T2 relaxation. Our denoising & registration protocol could shorten total scan time for CDTI by reducing the number of averages needed, which would have a big impact on patient experience and accuracy of results.  



## ü¶ï Startups

I enjoy startups just as much as academia, and I have been a machine learning intern at GenusOne Inc. since May 2019. Working with the founding team, I've developed documentation for the company‚Äôs platform and have created & tested a number of original machine learning applications. Additionally, I implemented GPU-based versions of kNN and SVM classifiers in C++ to demostrate the efficiency of the company's platform.

To learn more about startups, in Fall 2020, I have taken the "Venture Capital and Finance of Innovation" class, where I've been learning how to use capital to create value from some of the most prominent speakers in the VC world (Klein Perkins, Bain Capital, Emergence Capital, etc.)



## üå± Service

As an international student from a remote region in Russia, I am certainly familiar with societal inequities and lack of access to opportunities that exist in the area of education. Hence, I am involved with the Pace Center for Civic Engagement as a Service Focus fellow: in the Education & Access cohort, we have been examining questions related to education inequality & access to opportunity and ways we can tackle the problem. As a racial justice fellow, I have also been helping Princeton's Prison Teaching Initiative team to create lectures and assignments for the first ever Java-based Computer Science curriculum to be taught in NJ prisons.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Research in High School


In the summer of 2018, I studied Forbush decreases in cosmic ray flux, analyzed URAGAN hodoscope muon data, and examined barometric effects in the cosmic ray muon and neutron flux at the National Research Nuclear University MEPhI in Moscow, Russia.

I have also worked with astronomers from the Ural Federal University Observatory on builiding and testing  a flat field light source that enhances stellar spectra quality. The tool is installed in the Observatory.

In my senior year of high school, I‚Äôve had the honor to be selected as one of the ten Russian students to travel to India to present my astrophysics research to the President of Russia and Prime Minister of India in October 2018.
