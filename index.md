## ü§∑ What I do

I'm a second-year physics student at Princeton University. At Princeton, I do research studying timing deviations in the TESS transit timing data of hot Jupiters üåç. It was shown theoretically that the orbits of many known hot Jupiters should be slowly shrinking because of the tidal interactions between the star and the planet. However, the timescale of tidal evolution is difficult to estimate theoretically. To date, the only known hot Jupiter for which orbital decay has been detected is WASP-12b. In this work, I search for evidence of tidal orbital decay by analyzing long-term timing of the transits of hot Jupiters. 

 


## üå± Service

As an international student from a remote region in Russia, I am familiar with societal inequities and lack of access to opportunities that exist in the area of education. Hence, I am involved with the Pace Center for Civic Engagement as a Service Focus fellow: in the Education & Access cohort, we have been examining questions related to education inequality & access to opportunity and ways we can tackle the problem. As a racial justice fellow, I have also been helping Princeton's Prison Teaching Initiative team to create lectures and assignments for the first ever Java-based Computer Science curriculum to be taught in NJ prisons.

## üë©‚Äçüíª What I've done before

In high school, I have worked with astronomers from the Ural Federal University Observatory on builiding and testing  a flat field light source to enhance stellar spectra quality. Our tool is installed with a spectrograph in the Observatory.

In the summer of 2018, I studied Forbush decreases in cosmic ray flux, analyzed URAGAN hodoscope muon data, and examined barometric effects in the cosmic ray muon and neutron flux at the National Research Nuclear University MEPhI in Moscow, Russia.

In my senior year of high school, I‚Äôve had the honor to be selected as one of the ten Russian students to travel to India to present my astrophysics research to the President of Russia and Prime Minister of India.
