title: Predicting Coronal Mass Ejections 
---

During the summer of 2019, I have conducted independent work analyzing solar flare time-series data to predict coronal mass ejections. A Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) is a significant release of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun into interplanetary space. Despite the progress in numerical modeling, it is still unclear which conditions will produce a CME; however, it is known that CMEs and solar flares are associated as “a single magnetically driven event”. In my study, I created a topological data analysis-based classifier in Python from scratch to predict whether an M- or X-class flaring active region will produce a CME in the next 24 hours. I then presented my results to Stanford and Harvard physics professors.
