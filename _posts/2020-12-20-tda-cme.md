During the summer of 2019, I have conducted independent work analyzing solar flare time-series data to predict coronal mass ejections. A Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) is a significant release of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun into interplanetary space. Despite the progress in numerical modeling, it is still unclear which conditions will produce a CME; however, it is known that CMEs and solar flares are associated as “a single magnetically driven event”.  CMEs are the primary source of strong **geomagnetic storms**, which are major disturbances of Earth’s magnetosphere that can lead to massive damage of satellites, power grids, and telecommunications/navigation systems. Therefore, it is important to forecast geomagnetic storms — and CMEs that lead to such events — in a reliable way. In my study, I created a topological data analysis-based classifier in Python from scratch to predict whether an M- or X-class flaring active region will produce a CME in the next 24 hours. I then presented my results to Stanford and Harvard physics professors.
