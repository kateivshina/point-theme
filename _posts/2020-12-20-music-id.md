title: Music Identification with Persistent Homology
---

I've recently ideated and created a song identification application using persistent homology techniques (Python). The goal was to find a representation of songs as a time series of topological fingerprints, with a metric to compare pairs of time-varying shapes. My algorithm accounts for noise distortions of input audio clips to identify music.
