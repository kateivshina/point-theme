title: Simulating a planetary system 
---

In this project, we write a two-body integrator using fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) integration method. Additionally, we write a python routine to integrate the two-body system using the leapfrog method. We then study HAT-P-21 exoplanetary system, using our two-body integrator and FFT.

## Two-body integrator with RK4 method

First, we visit [this](http://openexoplanetcatalogue.com/planet/HAT-P-21%20b/) website to fetch the planet mass, the orbital eccentricity, the semi-major axis, and the host star's mass. 

$$a_k$$

$y = x^2 \hbox{ when $x > 2$}$

```math  
a + b_k = c
```
